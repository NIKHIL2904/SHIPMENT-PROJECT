# SHIPMENT-PROJECT

To find the appropriate amount of weight to ship from one port to another following the shortest path possible which in case shows the minimum expense and max profit possible on a
shipment.

The main reason to choose the topic is to apply the knapsack and dijkstra algorithm in real life situations so as to get optimal solutions. By this project we can further examine how we can
use different algorithms in different real life situations.

1.Modified 0/1 knapsack problem:We have applied this algorithm so as whenever a user enters a weight by the application of the knapsack problem we can calculate the optimal weight that it can carry so
as to get the maximum profit.
2.Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:We have applied the Djikstra algorithm so as to calculate the minimum distance the ship has to travel and thus get the minimum distance possible and therefore helping us to calculate the
optimal expense so as to get maximum profit possible.

For running a large port, and controlling shipments we have decided to find an optimal solution so as the ship can operate at minimum expense and max profit the project aims to reduce the man
labour and in these kinds of calculations. Hence increasing the accuracy and improving the redundancy of the shipping company and port.
